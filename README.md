# SDIGuardCLI :passport_control:
## Command line tool to authenticate with the SDIGuard firewall in Abertay University
---

**Note this is beta software and has not been fully tested.**

This Python script is a simple way to authenticate with the firewall in the Computing Lab or Hacklab in Abertay University.

The main use case for this is when using devices without a GUI, such as a Raspberry Pi over SSH.

If there are any issues with this tool, please open an issue on this repo or send me an email (you'll find my address on the University website on in the directory on Office365.)

*Note: Remember you must read and accept the terms and conditions on the firewall page, and abide by all University Policies!*

Dependencies: Requests - *pip install requests*
